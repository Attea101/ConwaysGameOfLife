# Conway's Game of Life - Implementation by Attea Williams

## Description
This is a Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The game simulates the evolution of a grid of cells where each cell can be either alive or dead. The cells evolve according to a set of rules that govern their survival, reproduction, or death based on the state of neighboring cells.

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using a Java compiler (`javac`).
2. Run the `ConwaysGameOfLifeGUI` class to launch the GUI visualization.

```bash
javac ConwaysGameOfLifeGUI.java
java ConwaysGameOfLifeGUI
